# Iri

Iri'S is an advanced virtual assistant inspired by the iconic Iri from the Marvel Universe. It leverages Python, OpenAI's GPT-3 API, speech recognition libraries, text-to-speech synthesis, and custom automation scripts to provide a seamless voice-controlled experience.

## Features

- Voice Recognition and Synthesis: Iri incorporates Python libraries for voice recognition and synthesis, allowing for natural voice interactions with the assistant.

- Custom Automation Scripts: We've implemented a collection of custom automation scripts that enable Iri to perform a wide range of tasks. From setting reminders and answering questions to controlling smart home devices, IriS has you covered.

- OpenAI's GPT-3 Integration: Iri is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 API, enhancing its natural language understanding and generation capabilities. This means Iri can hold more conversational and context-aware conversations with you.
